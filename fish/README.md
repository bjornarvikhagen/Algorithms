## Introduction

The Fish Handling Algorithms repository aims to provide a set of algorithms and tools that can assist fish handling professionals in improving their practices and achieving better outcomes in terms of fish health, productivity, and sustainability. The algorithms offered here are designed to address specific challenges in fish handling and provide data-driven solutions.

## Algorithms

### 1. Fish Handling Algorithm

The Fish Handling Algorithm provides recommendations for optimal handling methods based on various factors such as fish size, stress level, and handling equipment available. It considers stress levels, fish size categories, and recommended handling methods to ensure the well-being and safety of the fish during handling operations.

### Works in progress:
### 2. Fish Health Monitoring Algorithm

The Fish Health Monitoring Algorithm analyzes various environmental parameters, such as water quality, temperature, oxygen levels, and pH, to assess the overall health of fish in aquaculture systems. It provides real-time monitoring, alerts, and recommendations for optimizing fish handling practices based on the health status.

### 3. Feed Optimization Algorithm

The Feed Optimization Algorithm optimizes the feeding regime for different fish species based on their nutritional requirements, growth rates, and feed availability. By minimizing feed waste and improving feed utilization efficiency, this algorithm ensures optimal growth and health of the fish while reducing costs.

### 4. Water Quality Control Algorithm

The Water Quality Control Algorithm continuously monitors water quality parameters, such as ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels, in fish tanks or ponds. It offers real-time alerts and recommendations to maintain optimal water conditions, ensuring the well-being and productivity of the fish.

### 5. Fish Behavior Analysis Algorithm

The Fish Behavior Analysis Algorithm uses video or sensor data to analyze fish behavior patterns. It detects abnormal behavior, such as aggressive interactions or unusual swimming patterns, and provides insights into potential stressors or environmental factors affecting fish behavior. This information can help optimize fish handling practices.
